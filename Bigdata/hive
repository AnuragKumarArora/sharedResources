        -1 For the file countries.tsv create
                -1.1 Managed table or internal
                       - create database test;
                       - use test;
                       - create table country_int (countryName string, year int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
        
                -1.2 External table or unmanaged
                        - create EXTERNAL table country_ext (countryName string, year int) 
                            ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
                            FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'

                -1.3 Describe both the tables.
                        - describe country_int;
                        - describe country_ext;
                        
                -1.4 Load data into the two tables
                        - LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/arora/Downloads/lab8/Indicator_data.tsv' INTO TABLE ;
                        - LOAD DATA  INPATH '<hdfs_path>/Indicator_data.tsv' INTO TABLE TABLE;
                        
                -1.5 Drop the two table to see the difference between managed an external tables of HIVE
                        - DROP TABLE country_int; DROP TABLE country_ext;
                        - observation : 
                                - Internal table : Managed by hive. On dropping it, the metadata of the table AND the data from the path (default path = /user/hive/warehouse) is removed
                                - External Table : Unmanaged. On dropping the table only metadata is GONE. 
                                                   The data still remains at the path provided while creating table.

        -2. Consider the wdi.tsv data set. The description of the columns is as follows:Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator code, reading of 1960, reading of 1961, reading of 1962, reading of 1963,  â€¦.. , reading of 2012

                - 2.1 Create the necessary external table and load the data
                        - create database test;

                        - One Mapper and one reducer. It takes REALLY long time to execute

                -2.2.5 Use sort by order to order your data. What do you observe ?
                        - select *  from wdi sort by reading2012,reading2011,reading2010,reading2009,reading2008,reading2007,reading2006,reading2005,

                        - to see the Difference set reducer tasks to more than one (eg. set mapred.reduce.tasks=2;) and the run the above query again.
                        -  The difference comes up when we have more than one reducers, partial results must come up. (LOCAL SORTING HAPPENS)
                           What happens when we do sort by ?
                           It is responsible for ordering of the rows within a reducer. Only guarantees ordering of rows within a reducer. 
                           Example : https://github.com/AnuragKumarArora/BigData-and-Analytics/blob/main/Lab8/Screenshot%202021-05-04%20at%2017.10.29.png`
        
                -2.7 Modify your reducer such that each reducer gets data of only a single indicator. For this filter your data for two indicators: Trade (% of GDP) and Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP) and only for the year 2010.
                        - set mapred.reduce.tasks=2; 
                        (In Below query no need to write OVERWRITE. It's simply written here to show that this can also be done. Omit OVERWriTE from query and run as it is)
                        - INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/arora/Downloads/lab8/distribute_test' select reading2010 from wdi where indicatorName IN ('Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP)', 'Trade (% of GDP)') distribute by indicatorName;
                        
                     Note : It will set number of reducers to 2. The records are fetched for 2 indicators and distributed on the basis of those 2 indicators. 
                            2 reducers will be created and each reducer will have value from distribute by. (that is what distribute by does, ensure non overlapping values will go to same reducer
                            to check : go to /home/arora/Downloads/lab8/distribute_test, we will be able to see 2 reducer outputs.
                            

                -2.8 Demonstrate cluster_by operation.
                        (ideally it should distribute over reducers i.e ensure that same value go in same reducer, and then sort each reducer locally. it will give
                        N(=2) files with sorted output locally with no 2 same value go in different file
                        - Cluster by = Distribute By + Sort By
