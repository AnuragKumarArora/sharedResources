1. Demonstrate TOTUPLE, TOBAG
    - stud = LOAD '/home/arora/labs/testdata/pig_data/students.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (id:int, name:chararray, age:int, loc:chararray);
    - all_stu = FOREACH stud generate id,name;
    - tobag_stu = FOREACH stud generate TOBAG(id,name);
    - totup_stu = FOREACH stud generate TOTUPLE(id,name);



stop_words.txt
the,and,up,to,a,of 


2. Consider the following document
   “Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale of water. Jack fell down and hit the ground and Jill came tumbling after”.
   Write a pig latin script to process this document: 
    2.1 Assume the words the, and, up, to, a, of are stop words and are to be removed. 
      inp = LOAD '/home/arora/labs/testdata/pig_data/ques2.txt' as (col:chararray);
      stop_words_inp = LOAD '/home/arora/labs/testdata/pig_data/stop_words.txt' as (col_stops:chararray);
      words = FOREACH inp generate FLATTEN(STRSPLITTOBAG(REPLACE(col,'\\.',''))) as col_name;
      stop_words = FOREACH stop_words_inp generate FLATTEN(STRSPLITTOBAG(col_stops,',')) as stop_col_name;
      joining = JOIN words BY col_name LEFT, stop_words BY stop_col_name;
      filtering = FILTER joining by $1 is NULL;
      remaining_words = FOREACH filtering GENERATE $0 as coll;
        
    2.2 Count the occurrence of the remaining words in the document.  
        - grps = GROUP remaining_words by coll; or grps = GROUP remaining_words by $0;
        - fin = FOREACH grps GENERATE group, COUNT(remaining_words.coll);

      (STRSPLITTOBAG = split the string and return splitted strings to bag (tokenize also same), FLATTEN - convert bag to separate tuples)
    2.3 Store the output in a file
        - STORE fin INTO 'home/arora/labs/testdata/pig_data/out'
